# Research

I am a senior scientist  
at the RFF-CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment ([EIEE](https://www.eiee.org/)),
which is part of the Fondazione Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici ([CMCC](https://www.cmcc.it))
in Milan in Italy.
My research interests include the modelling of human and environmental systems in the context of climate change, the decision making under uncertainty and advances in optimization frameworks.

In the past, I developed numerical methods to couple models of different kind in an optimization framework
(for example, the coupling of the economy and the climate, the energy system and air pollution). I also developed an open-source energy system model [ETEM](https://github.com/lolow/leaqweb/blob/master/lib/etem/etem.gms.template) in GAMS and GMPL.

I currently co-lead the development of the [WITCH model](http://www.witchmodel.org) which aims at assessing climate change impacts and the solutions to takle them.
I was involved in the implementation of various model components: energy system, economy, land-use, climate, air pollution, mitigation options and impacts.
