abstract = "The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a commonly employed metric of the expected economic damages expected from carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Although useful in an optimal policy context, a world-level approach obscures the heterogeneous geography of climate damage and vast differences in country-level contributions to the global SCC, as well as climate and socio-economic uncertainties, which are larger at the regional level. Here we estimate country-level contributions to the SCC using recent climate model projections, empirical climate-driven economic damage estimations and socio-economic projections. Central specifications show high global SCC values (median, $417 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> (tCO<sub>2</sub>); 66% confidence intervals, US$177–805 per tCO<sub>2</sub>) and a country-level SCC that is unequally distributed. However, the relative ranking of countries is robust to different specifications: countries that incur large fractions of the global cost consistently include India, China, Saudi Arabia and the United States."

### Github

This paper has a repository at https://country-level-scc.github.io.

### Online explorer

In this study, we have generated the Social Cost of Carbon of all
countries using different socio-economic, climatic or damage assumptions.
This is a large database. So, I developed an online interactive tool 
to explore it. This tool is available at
https://country-level-scc.github.io/explorer.
