abstract = "The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a commonly employed metric of the expected economic damages expected from carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Although useful in an optimal policy context, a world-level approach obscures the heterogeneous geography of climate damage and vast differences in country-level contributions to the global SCC, as well as climate and socio-economic uncertainties, which are larger at the regional level. Here we estimate country-level contributions to the SCC using recent climate model projections, empirical climate-driven economic damage estimations and socio-economic projections. Central specifications show high global SCC values (median, $417 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> (tCO<sub>2</sub>); 66% confidence intervals, US$177â€“805 per tCO<sub>2</sub>) and a country-level SCC that is unequally distributed. However, the relative ranking of countries is robust to different specifications: countries that incur large fractions of the global cost consistently include India, China, Saudi Arabia and the United States."

In this study, we have generated the Social Cost of Carbon of all
countries using different socio-economic, climatic or damage assumptions.
This is a large database. So, I developed an online interactive tool 
to explore it. This tool is available at
https://country-level-scc.github.io/explorer.

Additionnaly, a website gathers 
all the material related to this paper at https://country-level-scc.github.io.
